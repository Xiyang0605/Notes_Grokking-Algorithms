#Chapter 1 Introduction to algorithms
- Binary search only works when your list is in sorted order.
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds.
- Algorith times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm - O(n): Linear Time; O(logn) Logarithmic Time.
- Big O notation lets ppl compare the number of operations, instead of seconds, ms -- it tells how fast the algorithm grows in the worst secnario.
- O(logn) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster as the list of items grows.
